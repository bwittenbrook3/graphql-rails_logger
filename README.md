## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-rails_logger'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

By default this gem formats params only for `GraphqlController#execute`.

If you want to change this behaviour, add `config/initializes/graphql_logger.rb` file and set proper controller and actions like this:
```ruby
  Rails.application.config.graphql_logger = {
    'QueriesController' => %w(create)
  }
```

## Configuration

There is an option to suppress (hide) the GraphQL Introspection Query from the console output. This may be helpful to declutter the console during client testing as these can be rather lengthy.

`config/initializers/graphql_rails_logger.rb`

```ruby
GraphQL::RailsLogger.configure do |config|
  config.skip_introspection_query = true
end
```
